Subframe began with a simple observation: why has building UI become so tedious?

We waste days on mundane tasks to build a product. We draw rectangles in Figma and translate mockups into imperfect CSS code. We sit around in meetings pushing pixels to correct mistakes. Rinse & repeat.

**This isn’t the actual work that makes a product great.**

What actually matters is the creative process — generating ideas, refining concepts, perfecting the user experience.

That’s why we built [Subframe](https://subframe.com/), a collaborative design tool that makes building UI effortless.

With Subframe, we give you a solid design system as a foundation so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. We remove repetitive UI work like writing CSS so you can nail the UX. And we bring your team together in a design tool that anyone can master, so everyone can build on the same page.

Subframe is the tool we always wanted: tailor-made for building UI, not mockups. Thousands of builders today trust Subframe to power their product UI.

After two years of beta, we are proud to [open Subframe](https://subframe.com/) to everyone.

And we’re just getting started. We see a future where Subframe understands your entire product. Imagine starting with designs that always match what you’ve built — with live data and perfect copy that fits your brand voice. Imagine autocorrect that cleans up your UI as you go, suggesting more intuitive page layouts based on your users’ behaviors. Imagine building your next feature being as simple as giving it a name.

If we’re successful, we build better products and feel a bit more creative too. That’s an exciting future.
